        "In this question you will write Python code for processing, analyzing and understanding the social network **Reddit** (www.reddit.com). Reddit is a platform that allows users to upload posts and comment on them, and is divided in _subreddits_, often covering specific themes or areas of interest (for example, [world news](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/), [ukpolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/) or [nintendo](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo)). You are provided with a subset of Reddit with posts from Covid-related subreddits (e.g., _CoronavirusUK_ or _NoNewNormal_), as well as randomly selected subreddits (e.g., _donaldtrump_ or _razer_).\n",
        "\n",
        "The `csv` dataset you are provided contains one row per post, and has information about three entities: **posts**, **users** and **subreddits**. The column names are self-explanatory: columns starting with the prefix `user_` describe users, those starting with the prefix `subr_` describe subreddits, the `subreddit` column is the subreddit name, and the rest of the columns are post attributes (`author`, `posted_at`, `title` and post text - the `selftext` column-, number of comments - `num_comments`, `score`, etc.).\n",
